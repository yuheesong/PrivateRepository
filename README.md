# PrivateRepository
Hello. This is my private repository!

This is C program of random ordering.
I made the program because I had to make random order of people when doing activities in order.

First, we input the number of people. We can input it up to 10.
Then we input names of each person.
As a result, the output shows people's name in random order.
